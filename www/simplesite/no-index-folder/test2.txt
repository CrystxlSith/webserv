This is test file 2.
It is used for testing autoindex in the absence of an index.html file.





############
To Test:
Make a GET request to http://localhost/no-index-folder/ and see if the server generates a list of files in the folder (test1.txt and test2.txt).
Ensure that your server is configured to support autoindexing (i.e., it should show the list of files when no index.html is present).
